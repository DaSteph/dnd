Ciaran Shannoni was born in the elven kingdom not too far away from Dolmenwood. 

His father Faolan was a highly ranked officer of the elves garrison in the outer reach 
of the enchanted forest. When Ciaran was young his father went on a journey 
into the forest to never return. Only one member of his party returned with memories
so uncertain no one could tell what happened.

So his mother Tr√©asa - a high priest of the god _______ - was in charge to raise the
half orphan Ciaran and his sister Saoirse who would lead her mother into the priest
profession. Now shaped by the magic wielding mother Ciaran reluctantly became a fighter 
and had an open mind for the magical world and the usages for him. 

However Ciaran had to follow his fathers profession and was trained by the guards
as every young elve on the court had to. With his affinity to magic he neglected to 
often his exercises to the displease of Eachainn his instructor. However, Ciaran did
learn enough to be able to survive on his own out of the safety. His touch for magic
benefited his abilities which allowed him to surpass his mates which would mock them
as a cheater by not following the pure fighters path. 

So once Ciaran had given his part of service to the guards he fairly quick decided
on leaving the court at all to feed his hunger for more magic knowledge. Something
he could not satisfy in this archaic surrounding. As he had undergone his first 
expeditions into the outer realm of Dolmenwood as a guard it seems a good idea to 
him to advance further into this forest. Eventually finding some traces of his lost
father but primarily to grasp the nature of magic and explore its possibilities.
